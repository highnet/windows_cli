## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it by sending an email to the project maintainers. You can find the contact information in the project's repository or website.
Please **do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by the maintainers. This helps ensure that users of the project are not put at risk while a fix is being developed.
