# Contributing to This Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! We appreciate your time and effort.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on the project's issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to discuss your suggested enhancement. Provide a clear description of the enhancement and why it would be beneficial.

### Pull Requests

We use a Gitflow-like workflow. Please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository** on the platform it is hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone <Repository URL>
    cd <Repository Name>
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. Branch from `develop` if it exists, otherwise from `main` or `master`. Name your branch descriptively (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-bug-fix-name`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop  # or main/master
    ```
4.  **Make your changes** locally.
    - Ensure your code adheres to the existing style to keep the codebase consistent.
    - Include tests that cover your changes, if applicable.
5.  **Commit your changes**. Write clear, concise commit messages.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Describe your feature or fix"
    ```
    We loosely follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
6.  **Push your branch** to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork's branch to the `develop` branch (or `main`/`master` if `develop` doesn't exist) of the original repository.
    - Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the changes and referencing any related issues.
8.  **Address any code review feedback** you receive.
9.  Once your PR is approved and passes any automated checks, it will be merged.

## Styleguides

- Try to match the coding style of the existing codebase.
- Follow common best practices for the language(s) and framework(s) used in the project.
